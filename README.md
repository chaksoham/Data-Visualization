# Data-Visualization
A treasure trove of data https://data.un.org/, go and download the International migrants and refugees csv, once you have the csv you will see it has data divided into sheets, mainly the first sheet has the data about the country and the values over years, while the next sheet has the data about the region. I did some pre-cleanup so that the data about the country only includes names of countries rather than regions or socio-economic zones.
Visualization done using race animation from matplotlib.
